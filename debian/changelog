    SANE and gphoto2 backends are split into the new packages libwine-sane
    and libwine-gphoto2. The libwine-twain package has been left as an empty
    transitional package.

    preloaders and wineservers installed into /usr/lib/wine by the package,
    and not any the user may have installed in /usr/bin. Closes: #361706.
  * Deleted rpath stuff from configure. Closes: #359251.

    Closes: #351965, #356189.
  * Wine now install its fonts under /usr/share/wine/fonts, not
    /usr/share/fonts/wine. (I've updated the packaging accordingly.)
    This should stop them from being picked up by fontconfig et al.
    Closes: #353495.

    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Feb 15, 2006.
  * I'm finally back to my old build machine now. I hope I got
    all the build dependencies upgraded properly. (Maybe I'll
    get around to look at some bug reports sometime soon, too.)
  * Applied patch to support GNU/kFreeBSD. Closes: #351953.
  * Installed the wordpad application into wine-utils.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Fri,  3 Mar 2006 01:07:03 -0500

  * The BUGS file has apparently been removed, so you'll no longer find
    it in /usr/share/doc/wine. No big loss, I assume.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon,  6 Feb 2006 12:46:58 -0500

wine (0.9.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.2.
    - Winelib Explorer app (just a wrapper around winefile for now).
    - Debugger cleanups and improvements.
    - Many wininet fixes.
    - Better autogenerated API manpages.
    - A bunch of Korean translations.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Nov 22, 2005.
  * Installed the explorer program into wine-utils.
  * Renamed wineeject back to eject, and decided to go with upstream's
    way to avoid the naming conflict: launch with "wine eject", not
    with a wrapper script in /usr/bin.
  * Grabbed the WMF patch by Marcus Meissner from Wine CVS.
    It suppresses the dispatch of SETABORTPROC escapes from metafile
    records (dlls/gdi/metafile.c). Some security-minded people seem to
    want this to be fixed right away, even though it's obvious Wine
    could never be a 100% secure program.
    Closes: #346197.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon,  9 Jan 2006 13:51:33 -0500

wine (0.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.1.
    - Support for Find function in regedit.
    - Winelib app to eject a CD.
    - Many MSI improvements.
    - Better support for running text-mode apps without X.
    - Improved support for various code obfuscation tools.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Nov 9, 2005. I know it's a bit
    late to package this, but I've been on vacation. I also
    know that there are newer releases, but my philosophy
    continues to be to catch up one release at a time (in
    case the newest one breaks stuff for someone), so just
    wait, and I'll get to the newest one.
  * Install the eject tool into the wine package, as it may
    be useful for installers (it doesn't just eject, it also
    forces wine to unmount the CD, closing any open files if
    necessary) and isn't very large. The tool is installed as
    wineeject, instead of eject, to avoid naming conflicts.
  * Added libxt-dev and libxmu-dev to build dependencies.
    Removed libgl1-mesa-dri-dev from build dependencies,
    as the X.Org Mesa (xlibmesa-gl-dev) is preferred.
    Closes: #336576, #337466, #338508, #343870.
  * I'm now building with libicu34-dev. Wine is written to
    link statically with ICU, but Debian's libicu34-dev
    does not provide static libraries (unlike the previous
    libicu28-dev), so I'm hacking it to link dynamically
    for now. As a result, the binary package now has a hard
    dependency on libicu34. I've notified the ICU maintainer
    of the situation.
  * Added Vietnamese debconf translation. Closes: #324126.
  * Install wineserver man page (finally). Closes: #83238.
  * Force libwine-dev man pages to live in /usr/share/man/man3
    instead of /usr/share/man/man3w.

wine (0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9. Closes: #326805.
    - After 12 years of development, this release marks the beginning of the
    - beta testing phase.  Everybody is encouraged to try it; while there
    - are still bugs, most applications are expected to at least install and
    - do something useful.
  * This version was released Oct 25, 2005.
  * Package description changes:
    "Windows Emulator" => "Windows API Implementation"
    "Binary Emulator" => "Binary Loader"
    "ALPHA release" => "BETA release"
    "developers release" => "work in progress"
    "MS-Windows emulator" => "free MS-Windows API implementation"
    "emulator program" => "binary loader program"
    Closes: #313189.
  * Added libxslt1-dev to Build-Depends.

wine (0.0.20050930-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made Build-Depends compatible with sarge, by making
    "xlibs-static-dev (<< 6)" an alternative for "libxkbfile-dev",
    "libxxf86dga-dev", and "libxxf86vm-dev", and compatible with
    potato (presumably) by making "xlibs-dev" an alternative for
    "libxrender-dev". All "xlibs-dev" alternatives were also
    strictified into "xlibs-dev (<< 4.3)". Closes: #333997.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 15 Oct 2005 03:24:22 -0400

wine (0.0.20050930-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated Build-Depends to reflect new X.org package split;
    Xrender was probably not compiled in in my last couple of
    uploads, but it should be now.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Tue, 11 Oct 2005 06:44:11 -0400

wine (0.0.20050930-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20050930.
    - Joystick force feedback support.
    - Beginnings of Win64 support.
    - Many MSI fixes and cleanups.
    - Font linking support.
    - Several OLE fixes.
    - Some fixes for MacOS/x86.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * The changelog reports a change to the shell icon cache
    that should reduce memory requirements, which hopefully
    fixes #332545 (not closing it before it's confirmed).
  * Added Swedish debconf translation. Closes: #331188.
  * Added Portuguese debconf translation. Closes: #331497.

wine (0.0.20050830-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20050830.

    - More LDAP support.
    - Beginnings of an MSXML implementation.
    - Better MSHTML support.
    - Emulated version now set to Windows 2000 by default.
    - Direct3D fixes and improvements.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Added libxml2-dev to Build-Depends, but did not split msxml3
    into a separate package. This means the core libwine package
    will now depend on libxml2, but I believe that's okay. It's
    a fairly common library, and msxml3 is likely to be same.
  * Install new LDAP library into new libwine-ldap package.
    Added libldap2-dev to Build-Depends.
  * Install new EsounD driver into new libwine-esd package.
    Added libesd0-dev to Build-Depends.
  * Install mscms into new libwine-cms package, since libcms1
    seems to have become a hard dependency for mscms. Removed
    the libcms1 from libwine's Suggests.
  * Added debconf-2.0 as an alternative debconf dependency.
  * Fixed wine-safe's prompting of user. Closes: #327261.
  * Built against libjack0.100.0-dev. Closes: #321222.

  * Applied corrections to German debconf translation.
    Closes: #313860.
  * The Wine packages no longer build-depend on c2man.
    Closes: #313266.
  * The wine.conf man page has been removed.
  * The config file in /usr/share/wine/skel has been removed.
  * The sample config file in /usr/share/wine/doc has been removed.
  * Install Win32 API man pages into the libwine-dev package.
  * Install msiexec into the wine package.
  * The winecfg tool is already in wine-utils, not sure whether
    it's necessary to move it into the main Wine package or not.

wine (0.0.20050524-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20050524.
    - Many MSI improvements.
    - More features in the file manager.
    - Better compatibility for Winelib import libraries.
    - SGML documentation moved out of the source tree.
    - Header files cleanups.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * wine-doc is no longer built from the Wine sources.
    Had to move ChangeLog.OLD into the main Wine package.
  * Added Japanese debconf translation. Closes: #307013.
  * Added Brazilian Portuguese debconf translation. Closes: #310654.

wine (0.0.20050419-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20050310.
    - Mailslot support.
    - Support for side mouse buttons (X buttons).
    - More Richedit improvements.
    - Loading of Windows registry files disabled for now.
    - Many code cleanups.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Acknowledge security NMU. Closes: #300306.
  * Split OpenGL and Direct3D functionality into separate libwine-gl
    package. Closes: #304815.
    Some people prefer split packages, some prefer merged packages,
    it's hard to please everyone. But since the contents of the
    libwine-print doesn't actually require a hard dependency on CUPS,
    I'll consider merging its contents into the main libwine package
    soon anyway, at least if people keep asking me why they can't print.
  * Added Suggests for libwine-gl to libwine. Though perhaps these
    suggestions should be on the wine package, not libwine?
  * Moved wineboot and regedit from wine-utils to wine. These can be
    essential to installing certain applications and you probably
    shouldn't need wine-utils to do that.
  * Install wine.desktop into /usr/share/applications instead of
    /usr/share/applnk, and use updated wine.desktop from Dan Korostelev.
    Closes: #214707.

wine (0.0.20050310-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20050310.
    - Initial implementation of a true Richedit control.
    - Shell extension for browsing Unix directories.
    - More MSI work.
    - PBuffer support in OpenGL.
    - Window painting regressions should be fixed.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Since stdole32.tlb.so is available, I suppose I could close the
    "stdole32.tlb doesn't exist" bug. Closes: #226903.
  * Since I'm now up to date, I will close the "new upstream version"
    bug. Closes: #271581.
  * Added Czech debconf translation. Closes: #298318.
    (With the way the Wine configuration is going, the debconf stuff
    should probably be removed, though. So far I've just held hope
    that they'd re-add some kind of multi-user capability someday.)
  * Someday I need to get around to remove old cruft, and use the
    latest standards, in the packaging. But since Wine has been
    suffering various breakages lately, I have an excuse for waiting
    a little longer.

    - Beginnings of typelib generation in the IDL compiler.
    - Many janitorial cleanups.

    an earlier Wine release by using http://snapshot.debian.net.

    - Builtin debugger improvements.

    - Beginnings of an architecture for Direct3D 9 support.
    - Many debugger regressions fixed.
    - Improvements to the IDL compiler and the COM headers.
    - New MSCMS dll (color management support).
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Mention Scott Ritchie's Wine packages in README.Debian.
    Since I have been sick a lot lately, I have not had time
    to review these packages yet, but I can at least mention
    them. After I bring the current Debian packages up to
    date, I'll review his packages, and if I like them, I may
    turn over maintainership to him. Until then, I'm only
    mentioning his packages with caution.
  * Suggest "icu" in libwine, since libicu21c102 apparently
    does not depend on it itself. Closes: #290158.
    (Should get around to building with the newer libicu28
     later on, since it has been available for a while now.)
  * Make winelauncher no longer tell you to configure Wine
    if there is no ~/.wine/config, since Wine no longer needs
    a config file.
  * Install control.exe.so and winver.exe.so into wine-utils,
    although I can't imagine a great use for them. Closes: #289163.
  * Install msiexec.exe.so into wine, since it can be useful
    for installers.
  * Added lib1cms1-dev to the build deps, for MSCMS.
    Added liblcms1 to Suggests for libwine. There's probably no
    point creating a separate libwine package for CMS.
  * Added fontforge to the build deps, for the bitmap fonts.
  * Install fonts (/usr/share/fonts/wine) into the libwine package.

    - Many compatibility fixes in the exported headers.
    - Replacements for the Windows standard bitmap fonts.
    - Lots of bug fixes.

    not *.html. Not sure when this happened, but the doc-base
    files are now changed to reflect this. Closes: #285669.
  * Added Dutch debconf translation. Closes: #283975.

  * Applied winelauncher patch from Kevin Shanahan which allows
    each $WINEPREFIX to have its own flag files to disable
    prelaunch and debug windows.
  * Remove binfmt-support-specific doubledash hack from winelauncher,
    it's apparently no longer needed (nor does it work anymore).

    This may not change existing installations, it may be necessary for
    you to change the registry entry yourself on existing installations.
    I've mentioned how to do this in README.Debian.
    (It may be possible to make winebrowser ignore the registry entry
    entirely and hardcode it to always use sensible-browser, but I

    - DOS devices and drives are now configured through symlinks.
    - Many shell32 improvements.
    - New task manager merged from ReactOS.
    - First version of wineprefixcreate tool for initial setup.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Redirect errors from final "kill" command in winelauncher to
    /dev/null, since any failures there should be harmless.
    Closes: #238065.
  * Install taskmgr into wine-utils.
  * Set ICUUC_LIB and ICUDATA_LIB variables for configure,
    needed to compile this Wine release against the old ICU
    version in Debian, as instructed by Shachar Shemesh.
  * Adapted skeleton wine configuration in /usr/share/wine/skel
    to contain DOS device and drive symlinks. For existing
    installs, it seems wine will convert the old config to the
    new symlink-based scheme automatically, for a limited
    transition period. But I thought it best to update the
    packaging now anyway, to make sure I got it right before
    it's too late.
  * Install wineprefixcreate into wine. This seems to be
    an alternative to copying /usr/share/wine/skel into ~/.wine.
  * Added Danish debconf translation. Closes: #234064.

wine (0.0.20040309-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20040309
    - Much improved winegcc tool, now used to build Wine itself.
    - VxDs are now separate libraries for better modularity.
    - Improvements and simplifications to the drive configuration.
    - New setupapi INF script to create the initial registry.
    - Many improvements to the various multimedia dlls.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Moved skeleton wine configuration from /usr/share/wine to
    /usr/share/wine/skel. Updated README.Debian to reflect this.
  * Install patched tools/wineinstall into /usr/share/wine.
    If the script happens to work, it might be better to use it
    than copying the /usr/share/wine/skel into ~/.wine, since
    it would also be able to upgrade an old installation, and
    has more tweaks, but I haven't tested this script much lately.
  * Moved wineconf from /usr/lib/wine to /usr/share/wine.
  * Install generic.ppd and wine.inf in /usr/share/wine.
  * There's no longer a winedefault.reg. Everything is handled by
    wine.inf. Added explanation on how to use wine.inf to
    README.Debian.
  * Create program symlinks manually in debian/rules instead of
    using dh_link, since these symlinks must be absolute, otherwise
    they won't work when "cp -r"-ed into ~/.wine. Closes: #235406.
  * Try to make winelauncher look for an existing config file
    in $WINEPREFIX (before complaining that you have to run
    winesetup). Closes: #235405.
  * There's now a man page for widl.
  * There's now a man page for winebuild. Closes: #114673.

  * Added winebrowser and expand to the wine package.
  * Added libfontconfig1-dev, libssl-dev, and libcapi20-2 to

    - Better support for video playback.
    - Full IME support for Asian locales.

  * The exec shield workaround was also disabled again upstream
    "because it caused too much trouble". Perhaps #224837 was
    some of that trouble. Need verification.

  * It seems regapi is no more, have to remove it from the
    packages. (A man page for it is not needed anymore then,
    which closes #83261)
  * The tool regedit supersedes it, so I'm using that now to
    build the skeleton configuration in /usr/share/wine. I
    patched regedit to accept input from stdin if a filename
    of "-" is given, so input can still be zcat-ed to it.
  * Updated README.Debian for regedit instead of regapi, and
    mention that regedit is in wine-utils (still).

    - Some reorganization of the source tree.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Install wine.bin-kthread and wine.bin-pthread binaries into
    /usr/bin to allow the threading autoselection to work.
  * The DNS lookup issues is also claimed to have been fixed now,
    probably because of the NPTL detection. Closes: #214252.

    - Support for the Xrandr extension.
    - Dll separation of kernel and ntdll is finished.
    - Many enhanced metafile improvements.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * DocBook DSSSL stylesheets are apparently no longer included in the
    upstream source. However, they have one available separately
    (in the "tools" module of CVS), so I put it into the debian/
    directory and let the debian/rules file generate the documentation
    itself (without using upstream makefile) using that stylesheet.
    I also chose to continue to build each book as many small HTML
    files instead of as one big HTML file, since that's the "tried and
    true" way, or something.
  * Some old plaintext documentation has also been removed upstream,
    they've been removed from the packaging too.
  * Added HURD and FreeBSD to architecture fields, as requested.

  * Install *.def files into libwine-dev.
  * Build-depend on libicu-dev, so that support for non-Western
    languages gets compiled in. Suggest libicu21c102 for libwine.

  * Noted that daily builds haven't been working lately
    in README.Debian. Closes: #213729.
  * Tried to fix configure to detect current freetype.
  * Started rewriting the build system a little bit to make it
    possible to make winelauncher configure Wine automatically
    without winesetup's help. This is not finished yet, though,
    and since I'm far behind on Wine releases now, I think I'll
    do it later. Still, I did get around to po-debconfify the
    still unused debconf templates (closes: #203286), and put
    a skeleton per-user no-Windows configuration into
    /usr/share/wine that it's possible to copy into ~/.wine for
    those who want to do so.
  * Updated README.Debian to reflect (some of) the above.

    in preinst. Closes: #202116.
  * Build-depend on libjack0.71.2-dev instead of libjack0.50.0-dev.
    I am not sure that this jack version will work with Wine, but since
    0.50.0 is apparently no longer in unstable, I guess I have no choice.
    Closes: #202237.
  * Changed wine-doc build rules a bit to be more in line with upstream
    documentation layout. This will change the directory layout in the
    wine-doc package, you may have to adjust your bookmarks. Closes: #202310.
  * Added winecfg program to wine-utils.
  * Updated Standards-Version to 3.6.0, rearranged debian/rules file
    a bit to have a separate binary-indep rule for building wine-doc.
  * Corrected sections in control file (finally).

wine (0.0.20030709-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed shlibs so we don't depend on nvidia-glx. Closes: #201257, #201300.
  * Found out that wine was never ported to alpha after all (the alpha
    references in the win32 headers must be from NT or something, there's
    apparently no actual code in Wine for alpha), so I removed that again.
    Now only i386, powerpc, and sparc remain.

    I'm not convinced that the code might work with a new jack version,
    so I'll still be compiling against the older version myself.
    Closes: #196014.
  * Since people keep complaining about libwine-arts depending on arts
    4:2.2.2, without telling me what's wrong with that, I now
    depend on arts 1.1.2, clearly an even older arts, but if they can't
    tell me what they want me to do, I'll teach'em to. Closes: #195518.

  * New build dependency libperl-dev (because of the new
    winetest program, which is supposed to be wine's new
    API test suite, but though it was necessary to compile
    it, I don't think it's useful to have in the debian
    packages, is it?)
  * There's a new winecheck script too, but I didn't include
    it either, as I'm not sure how it works and whether it
    would be useful in Debian packages.
  * Made the dependency on xbase-clients versioned >= 4.0,
    so it doesn't satisfy potato xfree86 3.x users, forcing
    the ORed xcontrib dependency instead.
  * Added Suggests: msttcorefonts (neat package).

wine (0.0.20010216-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dependency on xbase-clients | xcontrib, since the
    winelauncher needs xmessage in order to operate.
  * Made winelauncher handle filenames with spaces. Closes: #87710.
  * Moved libwine's unused config stuff to wine (though still not used).
  * Fixed bashism in libwine.preinst. Closes: #87864.
  * Added French debconf translations. Closes: #87749, #87750.

wine (0.0.20010216-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Gave in and killed the OSMesa support, by overriding
    the config.cache with a debian/config.anticache in rules.
    Sadly, users most likely can no longer use plain old non-GLX
    Mesa (without hardware acceleration) to play Half-Life at 0.2 fps
    anymore, but maybe that's no big loss anyway.
    Closes: #83391, #83393.
  * Removed MesaGL mess explanation from README.Debian again.
  * Changed german translation of libwine.templates. Closes: #87604.

wine (0.0.20010216-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made Wine a handler of the application/x-msdos-program MIME
    type. (Soon your Unix mailers will also be able to run all
    those Windows viruses, muahahaha...)
  * Added a GNOME file association for that too.
    (But I don't know how to do that for KDE... if there's anything
    extra I need to do to make it work in KDE too, send a patch
    to the bug tracker or something)
  * Moved winemaker manpage to where winemaker is now (wine-utils).
  * Added "undocumented" manpage for specmaker and wine.bin.

wine (0.0.20010216-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Oops... seems that as I moved from one machine to another, the
    0.0.20010216-1 was built on top of 0.0.20010112-2, not -3.
    Now I've imported the changes that was done to -3
    (changelog and shlibs.local)...

wine (0.0.20010216-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20010216.
    - Several PostScript driver enhancements.
    - Improved enhanced metafiles support.
    - Beginnings of PowerPC support.
    - Lots of bug fixes. (Closes: #83214)
  * libwine_tsx11.so is new, placed it in /usr/lib.
  * specmaker is new, placed it in wine-utils.
  * Updated README.Debian to explain the MesaGL mess.
  * Built with debhelper v3.
  * Moved winemaker from libwine-dev to wine-utils, since it's just a
    porting tool for preparing windows for winelib compilation, not
    a build requirement once the sources have been prepared.
  * Removed rpath hack from debian/rules, assuming that winelauncher
    does a good enough job (or recognizing that the upstream configure
    adds rpath itself so I wouldn't have to anyway).
  * Patched winelauncher a lot, so now it works without rpath in the
    Debian packaging, and works with the winelib apps.
  * Moved /usr/lib/*.so symlinks to libwine-dev.
  * Finally moved the /var/lib/wine stuff from libwine to wine.
  * Someone apparently translated libwine.templates to German.
    While not terribly useful (the first message might be obsolete
    and the other isn't actually used, at least not right now),
    especially not without also translating wine.templates, I just
    threw it into libwine.templates anyway to close the bug.
    Closes: #83366.

wine (0.0.20010112-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added shlibs.local, to use "xlibosmesa3 | mesag3" instead of just
    xlibosmesa3, so that users that use mesag3 can just add a symlink
    (or mesag3 can be made to provide such a symlink itself).
    On the other hand, would adding a Build-Conflicts: xlibosmesa-dev
    (and build without OSMesa support) be a better idea...?
  * Removed bashism from winelauncher script. Closes: #83559.

wine (0.0.20010112-2) unstable; urgency=low

wine (0.0.20010112-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20010112.
    This version of Wine unfortunately doesn't support a global config
    file, so the default wine.conf is now removed from the package.
    I'll just have to recommend using winesetuptk for now.
  * Using debconf to notify the sysadmin of the above issue, and ask
    whether to delete /etc/wine.conf.
  * Decided to use winelauncher like it was intended; rename the main
    wine binary to wine.bin, and rename winelauncher to wine.
    This will also automatically launch winesetup if there's no config.
  * Removing wine.conf in postrm if wine is purged.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 13 Jan 2001 16:38:56 +0100

wine (0.0.20001222-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added usr/lib to libwine-dev.dirs. (Oops.)
  * Added ldconfig to libwine.postinst.
  * Now that winesetuptk is available, I added winesetup to Suggests,
    and mentioned it in README.Debian. The next Wine release ought to
    have support for a new global config file, I plan to remove wine.conf
    from the package once that happens.
  * Added information about other sources for Wine .deb packages
    (from the WineHQ download page) to README.Debian.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Thu, 11 Jan 2001 18:34:39 +0100

wine (0.0.20001222-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20001222.
    The configuration file format has changed, but I've kept the wine.conf
    in here since the winesetuptk tool isn't ready yet (I'm waiting for it
    to handle the new configuration file format), and wine will simply
    automatically generate a ~/.wine/config using the old wine.conf.
  * Updated README.Debian to explain these config issues.
  * Built more of the winelib apps, put some of them (including the
    all-important "winemine") into wine-utils.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 23 Dec 2000 04:54:03 +0100

wine (0.0.20001202-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20001202.
    New tools winelauncher and wineshelllink.
    Updated wine.conf.
    (I ought to use winelauncher for something, maybe soon.)
  * Updated Build-Depends for XFree86 4.0.
  * Install regapi into wine. Closes: #76138, #47857.
    Also put winedefault.reg into wine instead of libwine.
    Will clean up the inconsistencies, such as drive setup
    and files being in libwine instead of wine, later.
  * Moved winebuild, wmc, and wrc from wine-utils and
    into libwine-dev, since these are tools required for
    compiling Winelib apps.
  * Added LDFLAGS with rpath set to /usr/lib/wine as arguments
    to make during build, so that regapi and winedbg works.
    Closes: #72243 (may have been closed by 20001026-2 too).
    Eventually DLL separation will remove the need for rpath,
    but I'll keep it until then.
  * Added a new fake drive for /usr/bin, so that wine can find
    winedbg.

wine (0.0.20001026-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Repackaged with debhelper, since debmake proved too limited.
    Closes: #69467, #69469, #69570, #70820, #71461.
  * The default wine.conf update and the libdir fix (and
    the repackaging) closes: #67381, #67382.
  * Reorganized wine-doc package, it now features HTML docs.
  * Took Windows directories with spaces out of the package proper,
    since debhelper didn't cope with them. Created them in postinst
    instead for now.
  * Some initial debconf support. But doing real configuration
    questions must wait until I've patched the upstream
    tools/wineinstall script for easier debconf integration.
  * Moved Drive C path from /usr/share/wine/drivec to
    /var/lib/wine/drivec for FHS compliance. (libwine.preinst takes
    care of moving the actual contents and performing a search &
    replace in wine.conf.) Closes: #70618, #70619, #70620.

  * New maintainer Ove Kaaven.
  * New upstream release
  * Update default wine.conf, fixed EXTRA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  * Set --libdir=/usr/lib/wine explicitly, the $${exec_prefix} didn't work.
  * Added a few Windows directories into the /usr/share/wine/drivec.
  * Add an empty winsock.dll file to Windows directory in libwine.
  * Initialize win.ini and system.ini in Windows directory in
    libwine.postinst. (Hmm. Wonder if a --purge should remove everything?
    If the user only wanted to remove the .deb to compile wine himself,
    that might be a bad idea if the user installed something...)
